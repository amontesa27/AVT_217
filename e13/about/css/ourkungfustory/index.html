<h3>ABOUT KUNG FU TEA </h3>
<p>Kung Fu, in its purest essence, is the desire for self-improvement and to expand one's capabilities beyond all limitations.</p>
<p>Here at Kung Fu Tea, we share that same desire. We hold the firm belief that it is our mission to continuously improve and expand upon our already stellar brand.</p>
<p>With over a decade of experience, we are the unchallenged experts in the bubble tea business. From the ingredients for our products to the customer service at our stores, we keep a strict and uncompromisingly high standard, setting a high bar for our competition.</p>
<p>It is our dream to introduce the Kung Fu Tea brand to consumers all around the world. For this reason, we are looking for business partners who are interested in joining us. With your help, we hope to expand our presence even further and ultimately accomplish our mission.</p>
<p>Our corporate headquarters is currently located in New York City. We have locations across the U.S. with several in Australia, Canada, and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Michael, Allen, and Ray were walking around Flushing, Queens. They had just returned from a trip to Taiwan and were looking for their favorite childhood drink: bubble tea. After some searching, they found a tea place, ordered, and sat down to discuss their new business ideas. In the middle of the conversation, the three of them immediately put their drinks down.</p>
<p>They were confused. This was not the bubble tea they had come to love in Taiwan. It was a mediocre knockoff. They looked around and saw a long line of thirsty customers. Looked up at each other and that’s when Michael, Allen, and Ray discovered their new business venture.</p>

<h3>Fearless</h3>
<p>Sean was quite happy with his bubble tea chain in Taiwan when his three old friends, Michael, Allen and Ray, gave him a call. They knew Sean had not only the taste, but also the talent for making authentic, exceptional bubble tea.</p>

<p>Hours passed as they tried to get Sean on board with their new idea, but Sean was not sure. He was impressed by the group’s passion and the prospect of sharing bubble tea with the world, but he had to weigh the risks.</p>

<p>Days passed. The phone finally rang.</p>

<p>Michael, Allen, Ray, and Sean were ecstatic to hear Sean’s voice on the other side of the line. The Kung Fu Master was ready to join the team.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Kung Fu is about discipline and patience. We took the method to heart and pioneered the use of actual tea leaves in our brewing process. As a team we had to try hundreds of kinds of milk and yogurt with rigorous product testing, and thousands of tea leaves to achieve our great taste. That’s because in Kung Fu, the key to achieving mastery and excellence is time and patience.  After spending a lot of untold hours on finding the best tea leaves and the most natural flavor of milk, we knew that we were ready to open our first store.</p>

<p>Whether you’re visiting our first store or our hundredth store, a store in New York or a store in Seattle, you’ll find our flavor is always consistent; that is the Kung Fu Tea quality.</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Masters</h3>
<p>We knew there would be a path full of challenges that we need to overcome in order to remain the pioneer in this competitive industry. Even when things got difficult, giving up was never an option. For us, whether it was limited space, cash flow shortages, or troublesome landlords, we pushed through to achieve our goals. Surrounding ourselves with those who had the same beliefs and values helped us get by. If any one person felt defeated, the Kung Fu community would be there to motivate them.</p>

<p>We constantly reminded ourselves that anyone could become a Kung Fu Master, as long as they dedicated themselves to their craft, much like we have. They could achieve mastery in their careers, hobbies, or lives through hard work and a fearless spirit similar to ours. All they have to do is remember that there would be no progress without the struggle.</p>

<p>Like us, our customers represent our brand motto: Fresh - Innovative - Fearless. Join us in challenging the beverage industry and challenging ourselves to be the best. If you ever crave a fresh drink, have fearless ideas, or dream of making something, we are here for you.</p>
